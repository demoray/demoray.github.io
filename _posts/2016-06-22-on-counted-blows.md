title: On Counted Blows tournaments

Rapier tournaments are traditionally fought until one combatant takes a disabling or killing blow.
A recent fad in the Cut & Thrust scene is use a tournament style similar to armored combat called Counted Blows.
In this tournament style, combat continues until a clock runs out, with victory going to the combatant with the most valid blows as judged by third parties.

The idea has bothered me for a while, but it has taken me a formulate my opinion for public consumption.

In traditional rapier combat, a lapse of defense is punished critically.
A fighter receiving a disabling blow is immediately out, which places defense as paramount.

In a counted blow tournament, defense is not punished, rather offense is rewarded.
Victory is determined by striking your opponent more than being being struck.
Tactics that are brutally punished in traditional rapier, such as the charging bull, purposefully allowing after-blows, and paradiddle attacks; are not only not shunned but standard fare.

While I love hitting people with swords, I dislike being hit.
This tournament format rewards hitting rather than not getting hit.

If the clock stopped and fighters reset upon each blow, I would gladly participate as this would allow more fighting without disincentivizing defense.

This involves swords, and while I support and celebrate all forms of sword combat, timed counted blow tournaments are not for me.

This is not the Art of Defense.
