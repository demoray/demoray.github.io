title: Cut & Thrust melee experiment rules
---

Atlantia is about to join the C&T melee experiment.  The <a href='/content/pdf/CnTMeleesExperimentProposal_March.pdf'>original experiment proposal</a> describes a number of goals and rules from the society.  Within Atlantia, our KRM has published an adhoc set of requirements.

* * *

As best I can determine, the following are the requirements for the C&T Melee experiment in Atlantia, rewritten to be slightly easier to read.

## Proposed rules from Master Giacomo.

1. Single sword with rigid parrying.  No other offensive weapons.
1. No more than three fighters per-side.
1. Numbers are not required to be equal per side at the start of the fight.
1. Armor requirements is society minimums.  Additional armor may be beneficial, such as hard knees and elbows.
1. Expect up tempo, but absolutely NO up force.
1. Blow calling must remain the same as standard C&T.
1. Video tape every exercise if possible.
1. Record statements from observers and fighters, recording their feelings and what they saw.
1. Report every event using normal reporting mechanisms, posting videos online for review.
1. All authorized C&T fighters may participate
1. At least one approved marshal for the experiment must observe the fighting
1. Authorized marshals may line marshal and assist as long as an authorized C&T marshal is not participating in the fight.

##### Additional notes from Master Giacomo

1. All reports will be shared amongst experiment participants, KRM, and Society C&T Deputy, and SRM.
1. Maintain minimum blow standard in calling and delivering, and document divergances.
1. If fighters have valid blows fall on them and do not feel it during melee, record it.

### Changes required by Society

These are the following changes that we need to include for our current phase:

1. One-handed swords only
1. Defensive secondaries are optional
1. A minimum of four combatants per scenario
1. All fighters must be authorized in cut and thrust combat for more than two years and have had no current official marshal-related issues on file.

In addition, we are required to provide the additional information in our reports:

1. The number of participants
1. Type of engagement(s) (Open field, broken field, bridge battle, etc.)
1. Details on any equipment failure or damage
