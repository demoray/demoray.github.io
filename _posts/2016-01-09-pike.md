Last month, I published a survey sent out a survey regarding the inclusion of Spears in Atlantian rapier.  We had a total of 71 submissions, with a wide variety of results.  With the ability to provide free-form answers for those that desired additional changes before support rapier spear, I transposed answers that were effectively different spear construction and a variation of "never" into those values for easier analysis.  Free form answers have been included at the end of the results.
