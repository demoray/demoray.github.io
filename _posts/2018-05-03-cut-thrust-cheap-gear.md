title: Getting on the C&T field cheaply
---

Since starting my stint as Kingdom Cut and Thrust champion during Dietrich and
Thora's reign, I've been looking for effective and cheap ways to get onto the
C&T field.  This is what I've put together thus far.  This guide requires
buying a few things in bulk, but individually, the same can be done for only a
few more dollars.

# Equipment

## Back of the Hands

From Foam Factory, closed cell foam sheets that can be used for back of the
hand protection for 50 pairs of glove for $32 using Volara [1] and $34 using
Neoprene [2].  Cut with sissors.

From Amazon, 3M Foam Fast 74 spray adhesive.  Spray adhesive designed for foam
and fabric.  16.9 fl ounce for $25.  According to 3M, 1 can supports 25 pairs
of gloves.

## Demi Gauntlets

From Piedmont Plastics, 1/4" HPDE sheets at 4'*8' for $57.  15 pairs of of
Articulated demi-gauntlets following Rainald's pattern on the Armour Archive.

## Back of the Head

From Home Depot, a ANSI Z89.1-2014 Type 1 hard hat for $6.97 [5].  These can be converted
into reasonable back-of-the-head protection following the guide from Philipp
Reimer of the Midrealm. [6]

## Elbows

From multiple sellors listed on Google Shopping [7], Mueller 4535 multi-sport
knee pads for around $12, for required elbow pads.  These can be found cheaper
in bulk, but bulk purchases do not have multiple sizes.

# Totals

Assuming free labor, a hand saw, scissors, and an oven.

* Back of hand padding: $0.96 per person
* Demi-Gauntlets: $3.80 per person
* Back of the head protection: $6.97 per person.
* Elbow Pads: $12 per person.

To get someone on the field with a three ring swept hilt from Darkwood, the total cost is under $24.
