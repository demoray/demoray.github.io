title: Getting on the C&T field cheaply
---

Since starting my stint as Kingdom Cut and Thrust champion during Dietrich and
Thora's reign, I've been looking for effective and cheap ways to get onto the
C&T field.  This is what I've put together thus far.  This guide requires
buying a few things in bulk, but individually, the same can be done for only a
few more dollars.

# Equipment

## Back of the Hands

From Foam Factory, closed cell foam sheets that can be used for back of the
hand protection for 50 pairs of glove for $32 using
[Volara](https://www.foambymail.com/VA2/volara-foam.html) and $34 using
[Neoprene](https://www.foambymail.com/NE/neoprene-foam-sheets.html).

From Amazon, [3M Foam Fast 74 spray adhesive](https://www.amazon.com/3M-74-Spray-Adhesive-Clear/dp/B0728439NJ/),
Spray adhesive designed for foam and fabric.  16.9 fl ounce for $25.  According
to 3M, 1 can supports 25 pairs of gloves.

Trace the back of your glove on the foam.  Cut with sissors.  Use spray
adhesive to glue to the back of the hand.

## Demi Gauntlets

From Piedmont Plastics, 1/4" HPDE sheets at 4'*8' for $57.  15 pairs of of
Articulated demi-gauntlets following Rainald's 
[pattern for Articulated demi-gauntlets](http://www.armourarchive.org/patterns/demi_rainald/) 
on the Armour Archive.

Use a handsaw to cut out the pattern.  Use an oven to gently heat the HPDE to
make soft, and have a friend help mold it to your hands.  (Wear your gloves,
hot plastic hurts!)

## Back of the Head

From Home Depot, an [ANSI Z89.1-2014 Type 1 hard hat](https://www.homedepot.com/p/3M-White-Non-Vented-Hard-Hat-with-Pinlock-Adjustment-CHH-P-W12/202195392)
for $6.97.  These can be converted into reasonable back-of-the-head protection
following the 
[guide from Philipp Reimer of the Midrealm](http://schiltslac.com/2016/03/25/how-to-build-a-hardhat-mask-back/).

## Elbows

From multiple sellors listed on Google Shopping, [Mueller 4535 multi-sport knee pads](https://www.google.com/shopping/product/17521999973957324313) for around $12, for required elbow pads.  These can be found cheaper in bulk, but bulk purchases do not have multiple sizes.

# Results

Assuming free labor, a hand saw, scissors, and an oven.

* Back of hand padding: $0.96 per person
* Demi-Gauntlets: $3.80 per person
* Back of the head protection: $6.97 per person.
* Elbow Pads: $12 per person.

To get someone on the field with a three ring swept hilt from Darkwood, the total cost is under $24.
