title: Pennsic 2018 Rapier Rules Summary
---


The Pennsic rapier conventions have been finalized, but only available on Facebook at the moment.  The rules will be made available on the pennsic website in the near future and in the Pennsic Book available on site.  While all combatants should review the full published ruleset, I have put together this (unfortunately long) reduction of the rules to identify the specific items of note that may impact you.

1. You must have at least one rapier auth prior to pennsic to participate in *ANY* rapier combat.
2. You must meet Atlantia's standards for armor and the hosting kindom's standards for all other equipment.
3. You must be inspected EVERY DAY you wish to particpate in rapier activity at Pennsic.
4. Marshals can remove the ability to participate for violation of the rules.  Including non-acceptance of blows, ignoring rules of engagement, etc.
5. Marshals court will happen after every warpoint.  If you are called in, as witness, defendant, or accuser, you *must* bring your KRM (Me.)
6. Tip, push, and draw cuts with at least 6" of blade travel are included as valid blows.
7. No blade grasping.
